Package: python-gpiozero
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, ${python:Depends}, python-rpi.gpio
Description: Simple API for controlling devices attached to the GPIO pins.
 gpiozero builds on RPi.GPIO to provide a set of classes designed to simplify
 interaction with devices connected to the GPIO pins, from simple buttons and
 LEDs, up to various add-on boards. The API tries to adhere closely to Python's
 idioms and naming conventions.
 .
 This is the Python 2 version of the package.
