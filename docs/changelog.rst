Release 1.2.0 (2016-04-10)
==========================

* Added :class:`Energenie` class for controlling Energenie plugs (`#69`_)
* Added :class:`LineSensor` class for single line-sensors (`#109`_)
* Added :class:`DistanceSensor` class for HC-SR04 ultra-sonic sensors (`#114`_)
* Added :class:`SnowPi` class for the Ryanteck Snow-pi board (`#130`_)
* Added :attr:`~Button.when_held` (and related properties) to :class:`Button`
  (`#115`_)
* Fixed issues with installing GPIO Zero for python 3 on Raspbian Wheezy
  releases (`#140`_)
* Added support for lots of ADC chips (MCP3xxx family) (`#162`_) - many thanks
  to pcopa and lurch!
* Added support for pigpiod as a pin implementation with
  :class:`~gpiozero.pins.pigpiod.PiGPIOPin` (`#180`_)
* Many refinements to the base classes mean more consistency in composite
  devices and several bugs squashed (`#164`_, `#175`_, `#182`_, `#189`_,
  `#193`_, `#229`_)
* GPIO Zero is now aware of what sort of Pi it's running on via :func:`pi_info`
  and has a fairly extensive database of Pi information which it uses to
  determine when users request impossible things (like pull-down on a pin with
  a physical pull-up resistor) (`#222`_)
* The source/values system was enhanced to ensure normal usage doesn't stress
  the CPU and lots of utilities were added (`#181`_, `#251`_)

And I'll just add a note of thanks to the many people in the community who
contributed to this release: we've had some great PRs, suggestions, and bug
reports in this version. Of particular note:

* Schelto van Doorn was instrumental in adding support for numerous ADC chips
* Alex Eames generously donated a RasPiO Analog board which was extremely
  useful in developing the software SPI interface (and testing the ADC support)
* Andrew Scheller squashed several dozen bugs (usually a day or so after Dave
  had introduced them ;)

As always, many thanks to the whole community - we look forward to hearing from
you more in 1.3!

Release 1.1.0 (2016-02-08)
==========================

* Documentation converted to reST and expanded to include generic classes
  and several more recipes (`#80`_, `#82`_, `#101`_, `#119`_, `#135`_, `#168`_)
* New :class:`CamJamKitRobot` class with the pre-defined motor pins for the new
  CamJam EduKit
* New :class:`LEDBarGraph` class (many thanks to Martin O'Hanlon!) (`#126`_,
  `#176`_)
* New :class:`Pin` implementation abstracts out the concept of a GPIO pin
  paving the way for alternate library support and IO extenders in future
  (`#141`_)
* New :meth:`LEDBoard.blink` method which works properly even when background
  is set to ``False`` (`#94`_, `#161`_)
* New :meth:`RGBLED.blink` method which implements (rudimentary) color fading
  too! (`#135`_, `#174`_)
* New ``initial_value`` attribute on :class:`OutputDevice` ensures consistent
  behaviour on construction (`#118`_)
* New ``active_high`` attribute on :class:`PWMOutputDevice` and :class:`RGBLED`
  allows use of common anode devices (`#143`_, `#154`_)
* Loads of new ADC chips supported (many thanks to GitHub user pcopa!)
  (`#150`_)
